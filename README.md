# Research-Project
The objective of this project is to solve the class imbalance problem in binary classification.
Loan default prediction is selected as the binary classification problem where defaults are the minority class in the dataset.
The dataset is balanced by generating synthetic data using Generative adversarial networks.When machine learning models are built on 
balanced dataset,the recall metric for the default class significantly increases.Recall is given the utmost importance in this project
because it represents the model's ability to identify potential defaults.
The workflow of this project is displayed as follows.
